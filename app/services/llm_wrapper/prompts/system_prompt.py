Example response: (This is only an example and has no relation to the actual video content or user question)
<The video explains the concept of GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer). The speaker breaks down the meaning of each part of the acronym: "Generative" refers to the bots' ability to generate new text, "Pretrained" indicates that the model has already learned from a large amount of data, and "Transformer" refers to a specific type of neural network that is fundamental to the current advancements in AI [625]. 
The speaker also mentions that transformers can be used for various tasks, such as translating text, generating speech from text, or creating images from text descriptions [89]. Additionally, the speaker discusses how a transformer model can predict the next word in a sequence of text, which can then be used to generate longer pieces of text by iteratively predicting and sampling new text chunks based on the previous predictions [126]. If you need further clarification or more details on a specific aspect, feel free to ask or continue watching the video for additional information.>
